# Graph Basics

A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of vertices (also called nodes) and a set of edges connecting these vertices. Graphs are widely used in computer science and can model relationships between objects, such as social networks, road networks, and more.

## Terminology

- Vertex: A vertex (or node) represents a distinct object or entity in a graph.
- Edge: An edge represents a connection or relationship between two vertices.
- Directed Graph: A directed graph has edges with a specified direction, indicating a one-way relationship between vertices.
- Undirected Graph: An undirected graph has edges with no specific direction, representing a bidirectional relationship between vertices.

## Graph Implementations

There are different ways to represent a graph. Two commonly used representations are:

1. **Adjacency List**: Each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices, indicating the connections in the graph.
2. **2D Matrix**: A matrix that represents the connections between vertices. A value of 1 in the matrix indicates an edge between the corresponding vertices.

## Adjacency List

The adjacency list representation uses a data structure to store the graph's vertices and their adjacent vertices. It is an efficient way to represent sparse graphs.

Example:
Consider the following graph:
   1
 /   \
2     3

The adjacency list representation of this graph is as follows:
1 -> [2, 3]
2 -> [1]
3 -> [1]


## 2D Matrix Representation

The 2D matrix representation uses a matrix to represent the graph's connections. Each row and column correspond to a vertex, and the value at matrix[i][j] represents an edge between vertices i and j.

Example:
Consider the same graph as above. The 2D matrix representation is as follows:

1  2  3

1 0 1 1
2 1 0 0
3 1 0 0


## BFS (Breadth-First Search)

BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all vertices at the same level before moving to the next level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of vertices to visit.

Example:
Consider the graph represented by the adjacency list: {1->[2, 3], 2->[1], 3->[1]}.
Starting from vertex 1, BFS visits the vertices in the following order: 1, 2, 3.

## DFS (Depth-First Search)

DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices of a graph in depth-first order, i.e., it visits as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure or recursion to keep track of vertices to visit.

Example:
Consider the same graph as above. Starting from vertex 1, DFS visits the vertices in the following order: 1, 2, 3.

## Cyclic and Acyclic Graphs

A **cyclic graph** contains at least one cycle, which is a closed path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A **acyclic graph** does not contain any cycles.

## Types of Graphs

- **Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graph**: A graph where edges have a specific direction.
- **Weighted Graph**: A graph where edges have weights or costs associated with them.
- **Connected Graph**: A graph where there is a path between any two vertices.
- **Disconnected Graph**: A graph where some vertices are not reachable from others.

## Graph Algorithms

There are several algorithms that can be applied to graphs, such as:

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm.
- **Topological Sorting**: Ordering vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on their dependencies.
- **Cycle Detection**: Checking if a graph contains cycles.
- **Graph Coloring**: Assigning colors to vertices with certain constraints.
- **Network Flow**: Calculating maximum flow and minimum cut in a network.
